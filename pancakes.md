super fluffy pancakes for breakfast in no time? Here we go :-) 

## What you need

* 200 ml milk
* 2 TS lemon juice
* 1 egg
* 50 g melted butter

* 7 g baking powder
* 7 g vanilla sugar
* 50 g sugar (I like the brown way more, but do what makes you happy)
* 1 pinch of salt
* some butter to grease a pan

## How to make pancakes

* Add lemon juice to the milk and let its sit for 2 minutes (we are making buttermilk this way)
* Whisk egg and melted butter with the milk
* Whisk all dry ingredients
* Now whisk everything
* Let some butter into a pan and heat it until butter gresed the pan evenly
* Put some dough into your pan and bake the pancake for about 90 seconds
* flip it, bake for another 30 seconds 

If you like to, you can add fruit or maple syrup to your pancakes. 
Oh, and by the way: Please have some Prosecco or Champagne! 

Enjoy!
