# French Brioche

Watch out, this recipe is dangerous, because you will skip all your plans to have healthy breakfast and want to have this instead. 

## What you need

* 300ml milk
* packages of yeast
* 5 spoons of sugar (I always use the brown one, but you can go for white as well)
* additionally 1 spoon of sugar
* 250g butter
* 1 egg
* 1 package of vanilla sugar
* 750g flour
* a pinch of salt

additionally:

* 1 egg yolk to spread over the brioche later
* a little bit flour while makeing the dough


## How we do this

1. Warm the milk, it should be warm, but hot or even boil and add 1 spoon of sugar
2. Stir in the yeast, so that it resolves completely
3. cover the milk with a towel an put it in a warm place so that the yeast can rise 
5. wait about 10 minutes, you can have a drink in the meanwhile :') 
4. Put butter, flour, the egg, sugar, vanilla sugar and the yeast mixture into a bowl
5. knead the dough until it is smart and even
6. cover it with a towel and put it in a warm place so that the dough can rise
7. time for a Happy Hour, because we need to wait for about 40-60 minutes
8. form a roll of the dough and divide it into 5 equal pieces
9. braid the brioche. I know its hard at first to figure out how it works, therefore I will give you some help in this picture:

Once you are at this point, only cross the end of all strands that are next to each other, 2 times. 
10. carefully brush the brioche with egg yolk
11. put the brioche into the oven, bake at 180° C for 30-40 minutes
12. Take it out of the oven, resist the urge to cut it and try now, it should first cool down. 

I like it pure, but you can also try it with butter, jam or whatever you have in mind.


Voilà!
