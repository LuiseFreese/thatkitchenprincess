This fingerlickin delicious Brioche is perfect for sunday morning, or afternoons, and I promise even as a nightly snack it works!

## You need

*for the dough*

500 g flour
7g dry yeast
250 ml milk 3,5%
about 80g warm and soft butter
50 g sugar
1 pinch of salt

*For the filling* 

200g marzipan
100-200g grated almonds
2 egg white
1 tablespoon sugar
2 sips rum (make sure it's good one, better do quality control ðŸ˜‡)

*For the icing*

1 tablespoon lemon juice
5 tablespoons powdered sugar
a little water

## How to do it

1. pre-heat the oven at about 50Â°C
2. Warm the milk (it shouldn't boil, just be warm so that the yeast dissolves more easily and can pre-rise)
3. dissolve the yeast in the warm milk
4. mix milk, flour, butter, sugar and salt and knead it wir about 10 minutes (dough rises more easily then)
5. place the covered dough in oven on lowest rack and let rise for approx. 15 minutes -in the meantime, you can quality-control the rum and/or prepare the filling
6. melt some butter in the oven in a loaf pan

7. mix almonds, marzipan, egg whites, sugar and rum and set aside 

8. take the dough out of the oven
9. roll out the dough so that it is about the size of a baking tray
10. spread the marzipan-almond mix on the dough
11. roll uup the dough
12. cut it in half
13. twist both strands
14. make the dough fit into the greased loaf pan
15. bake for ~45 minutes at 160Â° C on lowerst rack, check from time to time that the brioche doesnt get too dark. If so, cover it with some baking paper and lower the temperature. 
16. prepare the icing by mixing lemon juice and powder sugar. If needed, add some water
17. Take the brioche out of the oven and spread the icing on it, let cool down
